# Shortest-Path-Scanner
Welcome to a shortest path finder. Link to an image of a rectuangular maze with any dimensions and recieve an image of the shortest path between any two points. The image will be autofocused so you do not need to upload the perfect image. If the image is at an angle or not centered do not worry it will still work. The software used to create this project is Python, OpenCV and NumPy.
